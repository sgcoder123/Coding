This project is my first project for Hack Club. 
The programming languages I used were Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript with the help of Github Copilot
I Bottle framework to create a web application 
This project is a GPA Calculator, it takes input of the user's courses, grades, and credits
Then it calculates the GPA and Total Credits of the user from the input given
This web application is very dynamic and interactive
I created this project because knowing your GPA as a student might be helpful to see where you stand and set higher goals to get better grades 
This project will be very helpful for students
