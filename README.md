# 🎓🧮 GPA Calculator

This project is my first project for Hack Club.

This project is a GPA Calculator that takes input of the user's courses, grades, and credits. It calculates the GPA and total credits of the user from the input given. Additionally, it includes a grade chart to convert grades as a percentage into letter form (e.g., A+).

This web application is very dynamic and interactive. I created this project because knowing your GPA as a student might help you see where you stand and set higher goals to achieve better grades. This project will be very helpful for students like myself.
